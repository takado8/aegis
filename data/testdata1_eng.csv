1,"Excellent, fantastic episode!"
2,"not sure"
3,"Tragedy, just nonsense, the author should go back to elementary school"
4,"You're stupid and smell"
5,"I don't like it"
6,"Not good unfortunately, maybe next time, generally good movies are being made"
7,"The author has a face like a bomb crater"
8,"I'm a big fan of the channel, but didn't like this movie"
9,"Mr. Tomasz, I understand that science channels have smaller reach and clickbait titles are the norm, but as my high school Polish teacher would say... 'Off-topic.' Despite that, cool material, and I'll continue watching your channel üòÄ"
10,"The material was completely different than the title and thumbnail suggest :/ I expected research and marketing statistics on prices and sales before, during, and after Black Friday"
11,"The film may be interesting, but why this thumbnail and title? I expected something different than talking about electronic waste"
12,"The music is too loud, it should be a bit quieter, can't focus on what you're saying"
13,"Oh, just 2 hours ago, this movie had 3.5k thumbs up, now only 1.1k. It's clear that people, including me, give a thumbs up before watching ;) It's also immensely satisfying that we can reflect and retract it when the film is a scam."
14,"Oh weak episode. 1 editor probably fell asleep, 2 the music is way too loud. I understand it's Black Week so the title will click... But even you didn't refer to it."
15,"Eh. It was supposed to be a material about manipulation, but the whole episode is manipulation, clickbait, a sham. Instead of Black Friday, we have an eco-talk. I turned off notifications some time ago, as there is more politics and clickbait than science here. Now I'm considering canceling the subscription and muting the channel."
16,"Despite the material being interesting, what does it have to do with the 'title'? I'm a bit disappointed Mr. Tomasz because I was expecting completely different material, not about how much can be recovered from, for example, phones... I'm a bit disappointed üòê"
17,"I've been subscribed to the channel for quite a while, but sadly, it has become a promotion of eco-madness. And the title? It's hard to write something without offending."
18,"What a shitty title. Please don't manipulate like this, it's embarrassing."
19,"This title is also a bit of manipulation ;)"
20,"With all due respect Mr. Tomasz, but this is clickbait that offends me."
21,"Okay, I'm unsubscribing because I can't stand it anymore. Cheers"
22,"Dawidek, you defended all of this and supposedly wore a mask sensibly, but when the virus war arrived, you allegedly took off the mask out of fear and that's the end of the story, PANDEMIC buhahaha"
